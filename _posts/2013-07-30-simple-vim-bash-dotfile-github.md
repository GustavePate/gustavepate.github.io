# Context

There are plenty of github dotfiles framework on [github dotfiles][github_dotfiles]
They are complicated and I don't want to add commands or aliases that I don't actually master.
This is for like minded person that I write this tutorial

# Create a dotfiles github repo

It's pretty straightforward and this tutorial isn't about git so. If you don't feel comfortable
with it just take a look at the awesome [github doc][github_doc]


# Organise your stuff

Basically I need to store on github only my  `.bashrc` and vim configuration files.
Including plugins.

The easier way to do it is maybe to store everything as it is stored on my `/home` in the repo.
The install script will then symlink the repo's content to my `/home`.

## Repo organisation

{% highlight text linenos=table %}.
repo_root
|_install.sh
|_dotfiles
    |_.bashrc
    |_.inputrc
    |_.vimrc
    |_.vim
        |_ bundle
        |_ colors
        |_ synthax
        |_ ...
{% endhighlight %}

Content of  `.vim/bundle` should be subrepositories in order to always have under the hand the
latest plugins version.

We will see that in [this article last chapter](#working_with_submodules).

# Think about the install script

I don't want to change my install script each time I add a dotfile, a vim plugin or whatever.
For my personnal purpose I think that a simple sequence like: 

1. Get latest change `git pull`
1. Eventually commit local changes `git push`
1. Resinstall everything `./install.sh`

Will work great for my need.

Indeed `./install.sh` can make the git pull/push for me ;)

## An exemple install script


{% highlight bash linenos=table %}.

#!/bin/bash

echo 'Dotfiles -  http://gustavepate.github.io/'

HOME_DIR=~  #For testing purpose
SYNC_ROOT=./dotfiles 
SYNC_FILES=$SYNC_ROOT/*

SCRIPT_FULL_PATH=$(readlink -f $0)
REPO_PATH=$(dirname $SCRIPT_FULL_PATH)

echo $REPO_PATH

# If Git is not installed...
if [[ ! "$(type -P git)" ]]; then
    sudo apt-get -qq install git
else
    echo "git installed.....ok"
fi


#Command must be run from the repo root
if [ ! -e $SYNC_ROOT'/.bashrc' ] 
then
    echo "install must be execute from the repo root"
    exit 1
else
    echo "command run from secure path.....ok"
fi

#Pull latest change

git pull

#Symlink all files and directory in the dotfiles directory to the home folder

#allowi bash  to find .dotfiles
shopt -s dotglob

#for all files and directory in the dotfiles directory
for f in $SYNC_FILES
do
    # take action on each file. $f store current file name
    echo "Processing $f file..."

    #strip the left part
    FILE=`basename $f`

    #create /home equiv for repo file
    H_FILE=$HOME_DIR'/'$FILE

    #create backup path 
    TIMESTAMP=`date +%d%m%Y-%H%M%S`
    H_FILE_BACKUP=$HOME_DIR'/'$FI'.'$TIMESTAMP'.bck'

    echo "Checking $H_FILE"

    #check equivalent in the homedir

        #if a link, delete it
        if [ -L $H_FILE ];then
            rm $H_FILE   
            echo $H_FILE" rmed...........ok"

        #if a dir or a file => mv
        elif [ -e $H_FILE ]; then
            echo $H_FILE" backuped...........ok"
            mv $H_FILE $H_FILE_BACKUP
        # weird
        else
            echo "WARNING: I don't know what to do with this file"
        fi

    #create a new link
    ln -s $REPO_PATH'/'$f $H_FILE
    echo $H_FILE' symlinked to '$REPO_PATH'/'$f

done

# Working with submodules

For the moment, my git repo only contains copies of others repository.
Let's I wan't to automatically keep my vim plugins up-to-date.

I can use [submodule][git_submodules] or [subtree][git_subtree].
Submodules is the common way to go so I won't go in details of using subtree.

## Setup a submodule

### Add a submodule

First add a submodule to your git repo:

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
git submodule add  https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive dotfiles/.vim/bundle/vim-fugitive
{% endhighlight %}

It clones `https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive`
in the directory `dotfiles/.vim/bundle/vim-fugitive`

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   .gitmodules
#   new file:   dotfiles/.vim/bundle/vim-fugitive

{% endhighlight %}

Notice how the change log only show you the directory of the submodule without all its content.

### Secure the submodule

Notice the `.gitmodule` file.
Let's take a look.


{% highlight text linenos=table %}
[submodule "dotfiles/.vim/bundle/vim-fugitive"]
	path = dotfiles/.vim/bundle/vim-fugitive
	url = https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive
{% endhighlight %}

pretty straightforward hum ?

You can tweak in in order to ignore changes made by you in the submodules.

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
[submodule "dotfiles/.vim/bundle/vim-fugitive"]
  path = dotfiles/.vim/bundle/vim-fugitive
  url = https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive
  #ignore changes in the submodule while commiting
  ignore = dirty
{% endhighlight %}

### Refreshing submodules

To refresh get uptodate submodules all you have to do is to type: 

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
git submodule init
git submodule update
{% endhighlight %}


# Conclusion

Et voil√† ! Here is a link to [my own github dotfiles repo][dotfiles_repo]
where you can find the latest version of the [install script][install_sh] I currently use.
It took me a little more than a hour to make it working (including typing this article).

I hope this will help you !
