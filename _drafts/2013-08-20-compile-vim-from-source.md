{% highlight bash linenos=table %}

In order to make +yy and/or *yy work (copy to clipboa
:echo has('clipboard') returns 0. In this case, vim is not compiled with the +clipboard

+python


:set clipboard=unnamed or set clipboard=unnamedplus to make all yanking/deleting
operations automatically copy to the system clipboard.

 If you're in insert mode you can still paste them with proper indentation by using
 <C-r><C-p>* or <C-r><C-p>+
{% endhighlight %}
