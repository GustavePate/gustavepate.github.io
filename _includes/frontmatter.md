#Welcome

Hi !

Like you, I sometimes work hard on a subject (hours or days) only to see me, six month later,
wondering how I had done it and searching google for "the good link that I used".

I decided to put my notes on this blog, If it saves me time, I hope it will usefull for you too
;)

As I intend to use this blog, primarily, for my personal use. It will be mainly around subjects like linux, python, android and the web. I created it to get a better understanding of nowadays
common web technologies (IRL, I'm more a back-end person).

I hope you'll find valuable information in this mess.

With Love,

Gustave
